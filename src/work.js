We used OpenGL, and I was in charge of making the terrain generation. I created a perlin noise function and used that to adjust terrain heights and calculate normals. I also used this to create textures that are drawn in based on the height. I learned a lot from this project, and the basics of terrain generation and how it can be used."},

We used c++ and alpha-beta pruning to create a functional chess bot that could play chess. My role was to implement the first step of the alpha-beta pruning by creating a minimax algorithm. This taught me a lot about algorithms and working in a team as well as optimizations to make the game run well."},
